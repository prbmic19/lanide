# Lanide Robust Extended — a 32-bit RISC ISA

<br>

This is the 32-bit extended version of my **Lanide Robust Native (16-bit)** ISA.  
It comes with an **assembler** and an **emulator** written in C.

Low-level / systems-y stuff has piqued my interest for a while now, so I built this project as a way to learn more about how ISAs, assemblers, and emulators work—and also just for fun.
